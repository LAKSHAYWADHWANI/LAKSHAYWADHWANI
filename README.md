## Hello there 👋
## Lakshay Wadhwani
**Software Engineer -- Python | Java | ML | NLP | Backend Systems | Data Science**
B.Tech CSE (AI & Data Science) | *CGPA: 9.13*

## What I Build
I design and build **data-driven backend systems and ML-powered applications** with a  strong focus on **production ready pipelines, clean architecture, & deployable code**.

My works perfectly fits at intersection of: 
- Backend Engineering
- Machine Learning & NLP
- Automation
- Data Pipelines
I focus on **how systems are structured**, not just whether they work. 

## Flagship Systems
I prioritize **fewer, stronger systems** over many shallow repositories.
### Cognify AI — Document Q&A and RAG-based knowledge system
A GenAI-powered system that answers questions over PDFs, documents, and structured files using NLP and semantic search.
**Highlights**
- Document ingestion and preprocessing pipeline  
- Semantic embeddings and vector similarity search  
- Context-aware question answering  
- Modular Python architecture (API-ready)
---
### Automated Resume Screener
An NLP-based pipeline to match resumes with job descriptions using semantic similarity.
**Highlights**
- Text cleaning and skill extraction  
- Sentence-level embeddings for matching  
- Scoring and ranking logic  
- Designed for batch processing workflows
---
### Web Scrapers and Automated Article Summarizer
Built automated scraping and text-processing pipelines for real-world datasets.
**Highlights**
- Scalable data extraction workflows  
- Text preprocessing and analysis  
- Structured storage for downstream NLP tasks
---
## Engineering Focus  
**Languages:** Python, Java, R, SQL  
**Backend:** OOPS, DBMS, SDLC, FastAPI, REST API,API First Design, scalability-focused backend design  
**ML & NLP:** Embeddings, semantic similarity, text preprocessing, feature engineering, predictive analysis.  
**Data:** Pandas, NumPy, structured pipelines,exploratory data analysis, matplotlib.  
**Practices:** Clean code, separation of concerns, reproducibility  

## Background

- B.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering (AI & Data Science)
- Leadership roles in NSS, E-Cell & GDSC
- Won various Hackathon.
- Hands-on practical experience through internships.  
- Strong interest in building systems that actually ship and solve a buisness problem.

## Currently Improving
- Test coverage
- CI pipelines
- System documentation

## Let’s Connect

If you are looking for someone who:
- Thinks beyond notebooks  
- Understands ML and backend fundamentals  
- Can grow into production ownership
- Understand GEN AI rather than just calling the API.
- builds real world buisness oriented system solutions.
